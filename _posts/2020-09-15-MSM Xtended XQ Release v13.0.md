Hello Everyone,

As It's already mid of September and Android 11 Sources are out as well, so we will like to release the Final Build of Android Q/10 aka XQ.

And as it's a final build of XQ, we would like to dedicate this to our beloved, Martin Coulon of GZOSP ROMs. Without him, Xtended would have been a dream till now.

Thus, we are calling this build as - "Tribute To Martin Coulon" !!!

Let's move To Changelog for this Special Build -:

* Added OOS Tile Style
* Added Option to Center R Style Notification Headers
* Added Dual StatusBar Mode
* Fixed Ambient Text not showing on AOD
* Added Ambient Text Random Color Option
* Added Option for Ambient Edge Lighting Accent Color Option
* Battery settings layout improvements
* Fixed Padding for SB & QS Header Icons
* Added New Navigation Bar Method (clean up)
* Xtended NavBar Pulse to Lockscreen & Ambient Display
* Xtended NavBar Pulse to Ambient Display
* Added Option for hiding Rotation Button in NavBar
* Added Option for QS Logo (Similar to SB Logo)
* Added Emoticon Logos for SB & QS
* Added Lockscreen Timeout Configuration (Who Else Than Alex Can Think for this)
*  Replaced Earlier Volume Panel & Media Card Options (FC Issues in Many Devices) with POSP Volume Panels
* Added QS Panel Image Backround Option
* Added Awaesome Brightness Slider Overlays from ZenX OS (Zenixxx, Special Thanks to him)
* Fixed Theme & Accent causing freezing issues
* Fixed Lags Here-n-There
* Many more optimization & fixes in sources to make it smoother

That's All for we have. We have tried our best to give you all a stable sweet experience of Android 10. We hope we will be coming with Android 11 Builds soon, though no ETAs. 

Please feel free to share your feedback, suggestions & issues with logs. If you enjoyed XQ builds, we would request you to help us through donations.

Lastly,

"Rest in Power Martin Coulon"

Best Regards
